PROJECT TITLE: Naari- An E-commerce website created using Azure.

PROBLEM STATEMENT/OPPORTUNITY

Presence of a business organisation online, can have a massive impact on it’s growth and success. In order to market the products online, it is important to have a good E-commerce website where the customers can review the products and make purchases. Nowadays online shopping is preferred by most of the customers since it avoids travelling and one can shop at the comfort of their home. When the organisation meets the demand of the customers it can achieve success. 
The website will not only increase the sales, but also act as a platform for expansion of business. It will also help the organisation identify the customers who are interested in their products. Management of business is much easier since all the transactions is recorded at one place. Organisations can also showcase their potential and creativity here.



PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In this project I have developed an E-commerce Website – Naari which is an online jewellery store. The website showcases various jewellery products available in the store. This website was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It contains a home page with a banner section, featured products section with images, ratings and price of the products. Then there is also an exclusive product section. The website also has a testimonial and top brands section. There is also a footer with four columns. The webpage is responsive for both mobile devices and laptops. The products page displays all the available products with it’s prices and ratings. The cart page shows a sample shopping cart. The Account contains a login and registration button that will allow the user to switch between login and registration form. In the top it also contains a chat icon which will redirect us to the Web App bot created using Azure QnA Maker and App Service. The website code was written using Visual Studio Code and the changes were committed to the GitHub repository using the appropriate extensions in the VS code. Then website was hosted using Azure Static Web App, by deploying the source code directly from the GitHub repository. Then the knowledge base for the Chabot was created using QnA maker. Then a Web App bot was created. The bot was embedded in the website. This bot will be able to provide information about the business and the products to the users.
